# Eat a Burger!

## About the app

This app allows a user to "eat" a burger with a button that moves it to the "Burgers Eaten" column . In addition, the user can "reorder" a burger and it will move back to the "Burgers Avalible" column. Finally, this app allows a user to create a burger by entering text into the input field and clicking submit. This places the new burger in the "Burgers Avalible" column.
